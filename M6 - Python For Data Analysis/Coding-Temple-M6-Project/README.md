## Scenario

This was a real take-home technical assessment that has been given to data analysts during an interview process. The goal is to assess their ability to perform analysis on a provided dataset. The scenario given stated: "You are working with a firm that provides consulting services for institutions of higher learning. The team has gathered some data about a number of schools, and they are hoping you can identify some meaningful insights that could help them as they advise various colleges and universities this year."

## Task

Analyze this dataset of American college and university undergraduate programs.


## Specifications

1. Discover & visualize the dataset to get insights. Include some key visuals and written conclusions.
2. Report on relevant statistics.
3. Discuss your steps for cleaning the data.
4. Explain how you identify outliers and what you do with that information.
5. Explain how you approach missing values in the data.



## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Submit a comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing your analysis. Ensure that your notebook is well-organized with a combination of code cells and markdown cells. Use markdown cells for explanations, interpretations, and any additional context. Utilize code comments to explain complex or critical sections of your code. Make sure your code is clear and readable.

2. **Visualizations:**
  - Include a minimum of 7 visualizations in your Jupyter notebook. These visualizations should be relevant to your analysis and help convey insights. Consider using a variety of chart types, such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, etc., to effectively represent different aspects of the data. Additionally, provide clear and concise captions and titles for each visualization.

3. **Presentation:**
  - Prepare a 5-7 minute presentation to showcase your key findings. Your presentation should cover the main points of your analysis and highlight important visualizations. Use the presentation to convey the story behind your data, emphasizing key trends, patterns, and insights. Once finished, please save this presentation as a PDF and add it to your repository.

4. **Your own README.md:**
  - The README.md for a data visualization project provides a brief overview of the project's purpose, datasets used, visualization methods, and final conclusions or recommendations. It acts as a guide to help users understand and engage with the project's visualizations and insights.
