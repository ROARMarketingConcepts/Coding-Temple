    <h1><b>ðŸ§ª Lab - MPG Predictions</b></h1>
  </div>
</div>

## Task
You are interviewing with a car company who is interested in hiring a data analyst/scientist to help them improve the fuel efficiency of their cars. As part of the interview process, they task you with the challenge to see which car qualities have the biggest impact on predicting miles per gallon (mpg). Your job is to predict the mpg given information about the car.

The dataset provided is from the [UCI open dataset list](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). The data dictionary for the dataset is below:

Variable Name | Description | Units
--- | --- | ---
cylinders | number of [cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_%28engine%29) the car has | discrete number
displacement | [engine displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_displacement) | cubic inches
horsepower | [engine power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower) of the car | horsepower
weight | weight of car | pounds
acceleration | elapsed time to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour | seconds
mpg | Target variable | [mpg](https://www.kbb.com/what-is/mpg/)
