    <h1><b>Applied Lesson - Iris & Breast Cancer Datasets</b></h1>
  </div>
</div>

> In this lesson, we will apply the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using both the Iris and Breast Cancer datasets, two well-known datasets in machine learning. We will explore both datasets through exploratory data analysis (EDA), apply feature scaling using StandardScaler, and then build KNN classifiers to predict the respective classes. By the end, we will understand how to handle classification problems with varying datasets, while appreciating the importance of feature scaling in distance-based algorithms like KNN.
